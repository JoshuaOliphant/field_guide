# About This Digital Garden

Welcome to my digital garden! This space is a living, breathing collection of my thoughts, ideas, and learnings.

## What is a Digital Garden?

A digital garden is an online space for growing and nurturing ideas. Unlike traditional blogs, which are often presented in reverse chronological order, a digital garden is organized more like a wiki â€“ with interconnected pages that evolve over time.

## Why a Digital Garden?

I chose to create a digital garden because:

1. It allows for non-linear exploration of ideas
2. It encourages continuous learning and iteration
3. It reflects the natural way our thoughts connect and evolve

## How to Navigate

- Use the search function to find specific topics
- Click on linked notes to explore related ideas
- Check out the [Note Graph](/graph) to see how ideas connect

## A Work in Progress

This garden is always growing and changing. You might find some notes that are fully formed, while others are just seedlings of ideas. Feel free to explore, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or insights to share!

Happy gardening!
